# Body Mass Index(BMI) Calculator

Based on height and weight, the BMI calculates a person's leanness or corpulence and attempts to quantify tissue mass. It is frequently used as a broad indication of a person's body weight in relation to their height. According on the range the number falls within, a person is classified as being underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the value received from the BMI calculation. These BMI ranges are sometimes further broken down into subgroups like extremely underweight or very severely obese, depending on variables like geography and age. Despite the fact that BMI is an imprecise indicator of healthy body weight, it is a useful tool for determining if a person is overweight or underweight.
